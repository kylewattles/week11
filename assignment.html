    The earliest evidence of tic-tac-toe is from Egypt, where 3x3 game boards were found on roofing tiles from around 1300 BCE. 
    In the Roman Empire, a similar game called terni lapilli was played around the first century BC. 
    In ancient India, a version called Pada was played using shells or stones. </p>
